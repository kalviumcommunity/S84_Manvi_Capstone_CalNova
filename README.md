🌟CalNova Smart Scheduling for Solo Professionals & Small Businesses

**Goal**: To build a full-stack web application that enables solo professionals and small businesses to efficiently manage client appointments through a clean, modern interface — replacing spreadsheets, WhatsApp bookings, or manual tracking.

## 🔎 Problem

Many solo professionals (like therapists, salon owners, and tutors) rely on manual or fragmented tools for managing appointments, leading to missed bookings, overbooking, and poor client experiences.

## ✅ Solution

A responsive web app that allows business owners to set availability, manage bookings, and track clients from a central dashboard. Clients can view open slots and book, reschedule, or cancel appointments easily—without needing to log in.

## 👥 Target Users

--> Salon owners.

--> Therapists and life coaches.

--> Tutors and language instructors.

--> Small clinics or wellness practitioners.

## 🔑 Core Features

**Admin dashboard:** Manage schedule, clients, and appointments.

**Client booking system**: Calendar-based, real-time availability.

**Optional notifications**: Email or SMS confirmations/reminders.

**Authentication**: Admin login; guest flow for clients

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React + CSS

**Backend**: Node.js + Express.js

**Database**: MongoDB / Firebase / PostgreSQL
